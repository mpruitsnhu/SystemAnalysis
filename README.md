# SystemAnalysis

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

=> DriverPass is a client who wants to develop a program that increases the success chance of student drivers passing their drivers exams. They want to create a system that your able to take exams, learn, and be liscensed legally. One thing I did particularly well is create a use case diagram that show the multiple use cases of the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

=> One document I would love to revise is the sequence diagram, I think I could have done a better job with the diagram by including conditions.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

=> I interpret the user needs by breaking down the emulated conversations and comprehending the overall big picture of the project. Then I created chunks out of the information that was provided to develop a understanding on how to develop the project. Its important to consider user needs when designing the project because you are developing your project for the user which provides value.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

=> Breaking down and understanding the requirements and understanding the use cases to develop the concept.
